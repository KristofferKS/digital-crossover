# digital-crossover

a digital crossover taking any mp3 soundfile, splits the frequencies at a crossover-frequency, and outputs a stereo mp3 with high frequencies in the right channel, and low frequencies in the left channel. 

it only takes mp3

you need to change the variable for the path to the mp3 file


# Example usecase

used to test speaker units if not having a crossover.
the output file is played to the amplifier - frequencies above the crossover frequency goes to the right channel - where the tweeter should be connected.
frequencies below the crossover frequency goes to the left channel - where the woofer should be connected.

this emulates a bi-amping setup for a single speaker.
